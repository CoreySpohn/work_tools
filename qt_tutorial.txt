From youtube series Master Pyqt5 by Alan D Moore Codes
Making the form:
    Open qtcreator
    File -> new file or project
    On the left side click Qt in the bottom box
    Then select widget

Generating python file from form:
    In the command line run
    pyuic5 -o form_name.py form_name.ui
    That will make a python file from the current ui file
    YOU DO NOT WANT TO EDIT THAT PYTHON FILE SINCE IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE
    UI FILE IN QT CREATOR

Referencing the generated python file:
    Basic setup for another file called main.py using form_name.py below:
'''
from form_name import Ui_Form
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets as qtw
from PyQt5 import QtCore as qtc

class FormWindow(qtw.Widget): #Would be something else if you didn't use widget above
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.ui = Ui_Form()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)

    def method_of_interacting_with_form(self):
        ...
    def other_method(self):
        ...
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = qtw.QApplication([])
    widget = LoginWindow()
    widget.show()

    app.exec_()
'''

    To access parts of the form, like input boxes you have to call self.ui.inputbox.text() or what
    have you
    To connect a button or something with a method you have to put a line in the __init__ function,
    something like:
        self.ui.submit_button.clicked.connect(self.method_of_interacting_with_form)
